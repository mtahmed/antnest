Schedulers

Each scheduler takes the number of machines, the speed for each machine,
the set of jobs
(in scheduling terminology, jobs) that are to be assigned to (scheduled on)
that machine.

If the list of speeds is empty, it is assumed that the machines are identical.

NOTE: This file uses the scheduling terminology, not consistent with the rest
      of the system.
